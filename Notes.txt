Notes 

Thursday September 17, 2015

Added preprocessing
 - filtered for students taking at least 10 courses
 - filtered for courses having at least 20 grades

Error creating pivot table due to duplicate entries
 - need to filter for student retaking courses
 - temporarily done by groupby then .last()

Resulting Matrix.shape = (60737, 4007)

Still need to
 - install cvxpy with -llapack or PYTHONPATH issue
 - create a list of missing entries to ignore
 - create a function to calculate frobenius norm with missing entries
